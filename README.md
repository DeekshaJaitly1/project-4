# üç∑ Wine Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying wines based on their chemical properties. The goal is to accurately predict wine types (or quality) using supervised learning algorithms and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## üìä Problem Statement

Wine classification is a common problem in the field of machine learning. By analyzing various physicochemical features of wine samples, this project aims to build a model that can classify:

- Red vs White wine  
**or**  
- Wine quality score (if using regression or multi-class classification)

## üß† Models Used

This project experiments with multiple classification algorithms, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- XGBoost (optional)  

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are applied to enhance model performance.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine) or [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). It contains the following features:

- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Output: Wine type or quality score
