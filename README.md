# 🍷 Wine Classification using Agglomerative Clustering

This project applies **Agglomerative Clustering**, a type of hierarchical clustering algorithm, to group wine samples based on their chemical features. Unlike supervised classification, this is an **unsupervised learning** approach where the algorithm finds natural groupings in the data without pre-defined labels.

## 💡 Overview

Agglomerative Clustering is a bottom-up hierarchical clustering technique that merges the closest pairs of data points into clusters, step-by-step, until all points are grouped into a hierarchy. It is particularly useful when we want to explore underlying patterns or categories in the data.

In this project, we use Agglomerative Clustering to identify patterns among different types of wine based on multiple features.
